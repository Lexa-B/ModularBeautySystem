# ModularBeautySystem
This is a framework for custom modular storage and organization of beauty products.
It currently only supports Red Carpet Manicure brand nail polish, but the intention is to expand support to any needed brand or category of product.
## Modularity
The system consists of 50mmx50mm blocks.  Blocks can be greater than 50mm, as long as they are a multiple of 50 and have the proper tongue/grove in each 50mm length.
## Connections
Blocks are connected using dovetail joints.
## Naming Convention
[Category] (EN Dash) [Item type], [(opt)Subtype], [(Opt)SubSubtype]
e.g. Misc â€“ Storage Bin, 1x1
